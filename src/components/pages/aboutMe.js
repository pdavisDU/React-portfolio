                    <p>
                            I grew up in Texas and recently moved to Denver. I have worked in real estate since I graduated college, but have since changed my career path to become a full stack developer. I find enjoyment in working out puzzles and learning how things tick, I believe that's why I enjoy coding so much. I can't wait to bring my tenacity and knowledge to help contribute to someones company.
