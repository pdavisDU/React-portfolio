        Welcome to my portfolio! My Name is Paul Davis and I recently
        finished a full stack coding bootcamp at the University of Denver.
        I come from a background in real estate, but I was ready for a
        change in career that would allow me to follow my passion. In this
        new career path I am able to create and have the freedom to
        explore many different technologies, as well as continue to learn
        and challenge myself in an ever evolving field. I feel as though I
        have finally found a career that allows me to thrive not only as
        an individual, but within a team.
